# PolyMTL grade comparison

---


In this repository, you can find jupyter notebooks that allow you to compare your grades in several courses.

To run the notebook, simply run it with an `ipykernel` kernel locally or directly online by uploading it to google colab.

Please fill in your matricule `mat` in the *Pre-processing* section.
